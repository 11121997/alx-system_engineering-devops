#0x08. Networking basics #1
============================
#What is localhost?
-A hostname that means this computer
#What is 0.0.0.0?
-All IPv4 addresses on the local machine(internet protocol version 4)
#What is the hosts file?
-The hosts file is a plain text file that all operating systems use to translate hostnames (also known as web addresses or URLs) into IP addresses. When you type in a hostname, such as wikipedia.org, your system will look into the hosts file to get the IP address needed to connect to the appropriate server.
#what is Netcat?
Netcat or nc is a networking utility for debugging and investigating the network.

This utility can be used for creating TCP/UDP connections and investigating them. The biggest use of this utility is in the scripts where we need to deal with TCP/UDP sockets.
#ex:
	1. Netcat in a Server-Client Architecture
	2. Use Netcat to Transfer Files
	3. Netcat Supports Timeouts
	4. Netcat Supports IPV6 Connectivity
	5. Disable Reading from STDIN in Netcat
	6. Force Netcat Server to Stay Up
	7. Configure Netcat Client to Stay Up after EOF
	8. Use Netcat with UDP Protocol
#What is /etc/hosts:
	-is used to map connections between IP addresses and domain names
